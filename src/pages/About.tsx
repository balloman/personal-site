          I liked video games so much as a kid that when I reached middle school, I decided I wanted to learn to make
          them. This was back in 2016, and since then I experimented a bit in C++ and Python, with some Android
          development on the side, before joining the robotics team at my school and ascending to programming leader.
          There, I grasped team leadership skills and introduced vision processing and autonomous pathfinding to the
          robotics team.

          I graduated college with my B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Alabama in Huntsville. (Go
          Chargers!) Currently, my passion is for what I call inventive development, which I guess is basically software
          architecture with a mix of impact. I really like inventing solutions to problems with my skills and get joy
          out of seeing others use my work if it helps them in any way!

          I'm primarily a backend developer but am pretty much full stack, with my main skills being in the entire .NET
          ecosystem, along with a strong skillset in React and React Native for frontend, but I have experience with
          Java, Unity, PostgreSQL, Blazor, Xamarin, etc.
